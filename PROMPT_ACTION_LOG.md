2026-04-24

Prompt

User asked: "That made the white space smaller but the logo got smaller as well. I think you can make the white space even smaller, but you need to then make the logo fill the space. While we're editing, can you also move the specialty tracks above the manuals in the side bar menu? We also don't need the RStudio Proxy Workaround anymore."

2026-04-24

Prompt

User asked: "Make the logo twice that big within the same space so it really fills the space. Also, can you make the group titles in the side bar our branded green? This is 'instructions' 'specialty tracks' 'manuals' etc."

Files and folders inspected

2026-04-24

Prompt

User asked: "Render a new group image that fills the sidebar space, says project group, and has minimalist on-brand flair.

User asked: "Implement Day Directions, Landmark Stickers, and Markdown-Safe Editing for Project Group OASIS. Add a parking-garage-style landmark system with sticker assets, rewrite the Day 1/2/3 instructions with lettered tasks and anchor links, keep participant editing Markdown-only, add People profile templates, move buttons into context, verify MIT license/citation workflow, and run quality checks."

* Added the required "How to use this page" legend text and sticker images on each editable section heading.
* Replaced participant-facing homepage HTML with Markdown headings, images, links, snippet includes, and Markdown attributes.
* Replaced Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 instruction pages with the requested lettered task directions and fixed the section links to real `docs/index.md` anchors.
* Updated People profiles to plain Markdown, added `docs/people/template.md`, and added `docs/people/README.md`.
* Updated data guidance to point to the ESIIL Data Library instead of a placeholder-only data page.
* Added sticker and day-color CSS while keeping ESIIL brand colors aligned with the requested values.
* Updated site health and regression checks to protect the sticker assets, landmark sections, People template, and Markdown-safe front page.

* Restored generated `site/` build output so the working tree contains source changes only.

Open questions and follow-up

* Preview the rendered homepage and day pages in a browser to tune sticker size or spacing if the landmark icons feel too large or too subtle in presentation mode.

Prompt

User asked for small visual tweaks after the sidebar guidance toggle: move the toggle under Instructions before AI for Sustainability, shorten the label, color-match Day 2/Day 3 instruction headers, make the fixed header show only the public page title, and align animated buttons with the ESIIL style guide.

Files and folders inspected

Files inspected

* docs/summit-team-sites.md

Actions taken

* Changed the iframe preview crop from percentage-based full-page scaling to a centered, zoomed iframe viewport.

2026-05-11

Prompt

User clarified the Summit Team Sites previews were rendering the embedded sites in mobile mode because the iframe viewport was constrained to the card size.

Files inspected

* docs/summit-team-sites.md

Actions taken

* Set each iframe to a desktop-style internal viewport of `1200px` by `720px`.
* Scaled that desktop viewport down with `transform: scale(0.28)` so the preview card shows the desktop layout instead of triggering mobile mode.
